# pandas_challenge

pandas challenge is an exercise to practice loading, cleaning, merging, organizing, and analyzing a large data set with the pandas package in python. 

School data is sourced from two csv files found in the resource folding containing information from each school in 'PyCity' and each enrolled student at each school. 

The data was analyzed within the PyCitySchools Jupyter Notebook to calculate average test scores and the percentage of students who passed (received over 70 on a test) based on multiple factors: grade, per student spending ranges, school size, and school type. The analysis was performed over the entire school district and on each individual school within the district.
